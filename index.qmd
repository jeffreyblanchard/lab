# Discover Life Below!

Microbiome research is one the most exciting areas of science today. Our laboratory's long-term research goal is to contribute to the understanding of forest microbial communities and their response to climate change. We particularly enjoy discovering novel bacteria and viruses in the Pioneer Valley, North Quabbin Woods and at our research sites at the Harvard Forest. Our fundamental research on underground microbiome communities has led to applied applications in biofuels, probiotics and biotechnology. Our research is currently supported by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/), [Department of Energy](http://energy.gov/), and [New England BioLabs](https://www.neb.com/research).
