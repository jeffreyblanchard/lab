**Vartika Burman** - Hi! I'm Vartika and I'm a Biology and Mathematics double major. My research interests revolve around the intersection of genetics and computational biology, especially in the context of evolution, and I plan to pursue higher education in that field. Outside academics, I really enjoy watching sitcoms and painting.
