**Nekeria Ransom** 
I am a Master’s student in the Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) program at UMass Amherst, where I also completed my undergraduate degree in Biology. I’m especially interested in applying my research experience and technical skills to a career in the biotechnology/ life sciences industry.
