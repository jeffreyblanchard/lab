**Nekeria Ransom** - I am a Master’s student in the Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) program at UMass Amherst, where I also completed my undergraduate degree in Biology. I’m especially interested in applying my research experience and technical skills to a career in the biotechnology/ life sciences industry.

**Sonya Ivkovic** - Hi, I'm Sonya, a major in Computer Science! I'm interested in the crossroads of biology and computer science. Whether that be bioinformatics, modeling, or machine learning, research is integral to enriching my experience at UMass. In the future, I want to work on software that will aid biological researchers or healthcare professionals.

**Vartika Burman** - Hi! I'm Vartika and I'm a Biology and Mathematics double major. My research interests revolve around the intersection of genetics and computational biology, especially in the context of evolution, and I plan to pursue higher education in that field. Outside academics, I really enjoy watching sitcoms and painting.

**Sophia Deligiannidis** - I am a Psychology and Economics double major at UMass Amherst interested researching how those with disabilities are impacted by the typical research recruitment environment, and how to avoid any discrimination within the new process that PROPEL is innovating. She wants to expand PROPEL so those with disabilities can confidently apply for research labs knowing their needs will be met.
