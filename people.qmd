**Sonya Ivkovic** - Hi, I'm Sonya, a major in Computer Science! I'm interested in the crossroads of biology and computer science. Whether that be bioinformatics, modeling, or machine learning, research is integral to enriching my experience at UMass. In the future, I want to work on software that will aid biological researchers or healthcare professionals.
