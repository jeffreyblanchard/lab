We have isolated new bacterial species from the surrounding forests, most recently a new genus Kineothrix whose members are turning up in many human gut microbiome studies and maybe responsible for the Love Bug Effect. This is a prime example of how basic science and taxonomic classification can provide benefits to human well-being. We also use environmental genomics to discover genomes of the bacteria that have never been cultured including intracellular and host-dependent bacteria. For most of our Harvard Forest metagenomes less than 3% of the DNA mapped to existing genomes which demonstrates vast discovery space still exists in soil communities.\n\n\nRevealing the Hidden Diversity of Terrestrial Giant Viruses\nUnexpectedly, we discovered 16 giant viruses in our climate warming study at Harvard Forest, including the world’s 2nd largest giant virus genome, 6 ranking in the top 100 and all 16 representing new species, genera or families.
