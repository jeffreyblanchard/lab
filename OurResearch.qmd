We discovered the worldâ€™s second largest virus genome (2.1 MB) and fifteen other novel giant DNA viruses in our soil warming experiment through fluorescence activated cell-sorting and have used Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to visualize novel candidate giant viruses (see figure). Currently we are using metanomics. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) has been collecting and archiving soil samples in the Quabbin Reservoir Watershed, including the Harvard Forest, and at other sites across the US. We are Identifying novel and emerging DNA and RNA viruses in Quabbin sites and associated climatic factors across in a 10-year time series. A key area of interest is determining the spatial distribution of these viruses.

### The Consequences of Long-Term Soil Warming

The Barre Woods experimental warming site at Harvard Forest was established in 2002 by Jerry Melillo. The past five years our research group has focused on the effects of long-term warming on soil viruses. Analysis of bacterial viral community composition is used to construct a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plot, samples separate into distinct groups by treatment type (see figure). Our virus research at Barre Woods indicates that long-term warming, such as that which the earth is experiencing due to climate change, will have significant effects on virophage, DNA phage, RNA phage, eukaryotic RNA viruses and viroid communities, thus ultimately feeding back to the climate system. 

### Ecological Metagenome-derived Reference Genomes and Traits (EMERGENT)

The Ecological Metagenome-derived Reference Genomes and Traits (EMERGENT) synthesis project connects genomic information about the soil microbiome with the broader ecological context. This National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research synthesis working group will advance efforts to harmonize molecular information for microbial taxa and their functional traits. For more information see the [EMERGENT](https://lter.github.io/lterwg-emergent-website/) GitHub project site.

I am Director of the [PROPEL](https://www.umass.edu/propel) program whose mission is to ensure equitable access to academic and research opportunities for all undergraduate students at UMass Amherst and have a team of undergraduate doing research to foster the development of the undergraduate research culture at UMass.
