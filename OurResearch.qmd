### Emerging Soil DNA and RNA Viruses

We recently discovered the world’s second-largest virus genome (2.1 MB) along with fifteen other novel giant DNA viruses in our soil warming experiment. These discoveries were made using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and we have visualized several candidate giant viruses using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (see figure). Currently, we are expanding our research using metagenomics to explore viral diversity across broader ecological contexts. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) has been systematically collecting and archiving soil samples from the Quabbin Reservoir Watershed—including the Harvard Forest—and other sites across the United States. Leveraging this 10-year time series, we are identifying novel and emerging DNA and RNA viruses in the Quabbin sites and investigating how their presence correlates with climatic factors. A key focus of our ongoing work is mapping the spatial distribution of these viruses to better understand their ecological roles and potential responses to environmental change.

### The Consequences of Long-Term Soil Warming

The Barre Woods experimental warming site at Harvard Forest was established in 2002 by Jerry Melillo. Over the past five years, our research group has focused on understanding the effects of long-term soil warming on viral communities. Our findings suggest that prolonged warming, similar to the global trends driven by climate change, has significant impacts on diverse viral groups, including virophages, DNA phages, RNA phages, eukaryotic RNA viruses, and viroids. These changes in viral community structure may have important ecological consequences, potentially influencing microbial dynamics and feeding back into the climate system itself.

### Ecological Metagenome-derived Reference Genomes and Traits (EMERGENT)

The *Ecological Metagenome-derived Reference Genomes and Traits* (EMERGENT) synthesis project aims to connect genomic data from soil microbiomes with broader ecological patterns and processes. As part of a National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) synthesis working group, EMERGENT is advancing efforts to harmonize molecular data on microbial taxa with their functional traits across diverse ecosystems. This initiative supports the integration of metagenomic insights into ecological frameworks, enhancing our understanding of microbial roles in environmental change. For more information, please visit the [EMERGENT](https://lter.github.io/lterwg-emergent-website/) GitHub project site.

I serve as Director of the [PROPEL](https://www.umass.edu/propel) program at UMass Amherst, which is dedicated to ensuring equitable access to academic and research opportunities for all undergraduate students. Through PROPEL, I lead a team of undergraduates engaged in research aimed at fostering a vibrant and inclusive undergraduate research culture across campus. Our efforts focus on mentorship, skill-building, and creating pathways for students from all backgrounds to participate meaningfully in scholarly inquiry.
